This is my first time using Github.
The files in references is the data I used to filter and the like for my code that I downloaded except the compressed files. I also could not include the local copy of ClinVar I downloaded to do my local database.
The figures file has image and table files.
The files in Data is the raw data and analyzed data that was not included in my figures.

## 📌 **Overview**
This project analyzes genetic variants associated with **Oculocutaneous Albinism (OCA)** using public bioinformatics databases, including **ClinVar**, **GTEx**, and **UCSC Genome Browser**. The goal is to update known mutations, analyze gene conservation, and investigate potential genetic causes of **OCA5**.

## 🧪 **Project Highlights**
✔️ Updated OCA-related mutation data using **ClinVar**  
✔️ Investigated gene conservation using **UCSC Genome Browser**  
✔️ Analyzed gene expression patterns from **GTEx database**  
✔️ Explored potential genetic causes of **OCA5**

## 📊 **Data Sources**
- 🧬 **ClinVar Database** (Genetic variants)
- 🧠 **GTEx Database** (Gene expression analysis)
- 🖥 **UCSC Genome Browser** (Gene conservation & mutation visualization)

## 📈 **Key Findings**
🔹 **OCA2 now has more reported mutations than OCA1**, previously considered the most prevalent type.  
🔹 **LRMDA gene** shows high conservation in the melanogenesis pathway.  
🔹 **Heatmap clustering analysis** suggests **NPNT and BDH2** as weak candidates for OCA5.  
🔹 **Potential underdiagnosis** of OCA due to partial albinism being difficult to detect in some populations.

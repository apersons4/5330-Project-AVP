Cooperates  with the E2 CDC34 and the SCF(FBXW11) E3 ligase complex for the  polyubiquitination of NFKBIA leading to its subsequent proteasomal  degradation. Acts as an initiator E2, priming the phosphorylated  NFKBIA target at positions 'Lys-21' and/or 'Lys-22' with a  monoubiquitin. Ubiquitin chain elongation is then performed by  CDC34, building ubiquitin chains from the UBE2D3-primed NFKBIA-  linked ubiquitin. Acts also as an initiator E2, in conjunction  with RNF8, for the priming of PCNA. Monoubiquitination of PCNA,  and its subsequent polyubiquitination, are essential events in the  operation of the DNA damage tolerance (DDT) pathway that is  activated after DNA damage caused by UV or chemical agents during  S-phase. Associates with the BRCA1/BARD1 E3 ligase complex to  perform ubiquitination at DNA damage sites following ionizing  radiation leading to DNA repair. Targets DAPK3 for ubiquitination  which influences promyelocytic leukemia protein nuclear body (PML-  NB) formation in the nucleus. In conjunction with the MDM2 and  TOPORS E3 ligases, functions ubiquitination of p53/TP53. Supports  NRDP1-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of ERBB3 and of  BRUCE which triggers apoptosis. In conjunction with the CBL E3  ligase, targets EGFR for polyubiquitination at the plasma membrane  as well as during its internalization and transport on endosomes.  In conjunction with the STUB1 E3 quality control E3 ligase,  ubiquitinates unfolded proteins to catalyze their immediate  destruction (By similarity). (from UniProt P61077)"

Ubiquitin chain elongation is then performed by  CDC34, building ubiquitin chains from the UBE2D3-primed NFKBIA-  linked ubiquitin. Acts also as an initiator E2, in conjunction  with RNF8, for the priming of PCNA. Monoubiquitination of PCNA,  and its subsequent polyubiquitination, are essential events in the  operation of the DNA damage tolerance (DDT) pathway that is  activated after DNA damage caused by UV or chemical agents during  S-phase. Associates with the BRCA1/BARD1 E3 ligase complex to  perform ubiquitination at DNA damage sites following ionizing  radiation leading to DNA repair. Targets DAPK3 for ubiquitination  which influences promyelocytic leukemia protein nuclear body (PML-  NB) formation in the nucleus. In conjunction with the MDM2 and  TOPORS E3 ligases, functions ubiquitination of p53/TP53. Supports  NRDP1-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of ERBB3 and of  BRUCE which triggers apoptosis. In conjunction with the CBL E3  ligase, targets EGFR for polyubiquitination at the plasma membrane  as well as during its internalization and transport on endosomes.  In conjunction with the STUB1 E3 quality control E3 ligase,  ubiquitinates unfolded proteins to catalyze their immediate  destruction (By similarity). (from UniProt P61077)"
